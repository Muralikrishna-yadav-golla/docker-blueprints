# docker-blueprints

A collection of Docker blueprints for learning and practicing containerization:

- `softwares/` — reusable software containers (Jenkins, Tomcat, Nginx, MySQL)
- `projects/` — sample project containers (Flask, Django, Angular)
- `orchestration/` — docker-compose examples to run multiple services together

Each subfolder includes a `Dockerfile` and a `README.md` with instructions on how to build and run the containers. Ideal for practice, learning, and experimenting with Docker setups.
